Project: "Emmet Builds Systems" — Professional website (static + lightweight backend) for selling and showcasing modular game systems for Roblox, Godot, and GameMaker.

Primary objective (short): Build a clean, developer-focused, responsive website that demonstrates credibility and converts indie developers into buyers/clients. The site must match the exact structure, copy tone, and UX described below. Do not improvise structural choices — if something is ambiguous, implement the *closest unambiguous option* described here.

Primary users:  
- Solo hobby devs (Roblox/Godot/GameMaker)  
- Small indie teams  
- Experienced creative coders looking for modular systems

Branding & voice (must use throughout copy/UI):  
- Name: **Emmet Builds Systems** (use as site title and logo text)  
- Tagline (hero): **“Modular systems for indie devs — plug-in code so you can finish your game.”**  
- Tone: Friendly, technically confident, developer-centric. Not corporate. Clear, concise, slightly playful. Use second-person (“you”) and short sentences.  
- Visual vibe: Clean, modular, developer-studio. Slight tech feel: cool slate/dark gray base, electric blue #3B82F6 accent, violet #7C3AED secondary accent, soft orange #FB923C for CTAs. Use monospace for code snippets (JetBrains Mono or similar) and a modern geometric sans for UI (Inter or Poppins). Keep spacing generous.

Technical stack (required):  
- Static site built with plain HTML5 + CSS3 + vanilla JS OR a minimal static generator if you prefer (must be exported as static files). If a framework is used (React / Next / Svelte), **export a fully static build** and include instructions.  
- Use Tailwind CSS or a utility CSS system if preferred — but final deliverable must include compiled CSS (no build dependency required to run on Replit).  
- Responsive: mobile-first, desktop supported.  
- Hosting & domain: deploy on Replit and provide instructions/README for connecting a custom domain and for steps to export the static site if needed.  
- No external paid services required to run core site; integrate optional third-party services via configurable embed keys (Gumroad, Itch.io, ConvertKit) so owner can add keys later.

Pages & structure (exact):

1) HOME ("/") — Hero -> Engines -> Featured Systems -> Proof -> CTA -> Opt-in  
   - Hero: big headline (tagline above), subtext: “I build clean, documented, engine-specific systems for Roblox, Godot and GameMaker — so you can focus on gameplay, not plumbing.”  
   - Primary CTA buttons: **Browse Systems (links to /systems)** and **See Demo (links to Demo game / external Roblox link)**  
   - Engines row: 3 engine icons (Roblox, Godot, GameMaker) with microcopy under each: “Built for Roblox. Luau-ready.” / “Built for Godot. GDScript-ready.” / “Built for GameMaker. GML-ready.” Links to filtered system views on /systems.  
   - Featured Systems: carousel or 3-card grid with title, short 1-line description, engine tags, demo video link (hosted on-site or embedded), price, CTA “View System”.  
   - Proof/testimonials: 2–4 short verified quotes (use placeholders initially).  
   - Opt-in: small form (email capture) — placeholder to connect to ConvertKit or Mailchimp. Form must use a simple POST receiver endpoint (can be mock) and show “Thanks” overlay on success. Include text: “Join 200+ devs for early access & templates.”

2) SYSTEMS / MARKETPLACE ("/systems") — full filterable shop page  
   - Filter tabs horizontally: All | Roblox | Godot | GameMaker. Default: All.  
   - Search box (title/keywords).  
   - Grid layout of system cards: thumbnail GIF/preview, title, short features bullets (3), engine badges, price, tags like “modular / documented / production-ready”, CTA: “View”.  
   - Product card must show a hover state with quick demo preview and two CTAs: “View” & “Buy” (Buy links to Gumroad or Itch.io external purchase, but provide sample Gumroad button integration that owner can replace).  
   - Pagination or infinite scroll (choose any but make it smooth).  
   - On top, small banner: “Need a custom integration? Contact me” linking to /contact.

3) PRODUCT DETAIL ("/systems/{slug}") — per-system page template  
   - Title, engine badge, price, short summary.  
   - Demo video (looping short demo) + GIF preview. Video must be hosted within site files or embedded via a configurable external video URL.  
   - Features list (short bullets).  
   - “What’s included” section: source file (not published live), docs, quick-start guide PDF (download link). The demo must *not* include full source code for paid assets. Provide a “Preview code snippet” box with 6–12 lines of well-commented sample (non-sensitive) code only to show style. Use monospace, copy-to-clipboard button.  
   - Compatibility & requirements: engine versions, prerequisites.  
   - FAQ mini section (three questions).  
   - CTA area with Buy button (Gumroad/Itch) + “Request custom integration” button (leads to contact form).  
   - Related systems carousel.

4) PORTFOLIO / CASE STUDIES ("/portfolio")  
   - 3 initial case-study-style entries (these are self-started showcases) — each with: Project name, “Problem”, “Solution” (what system was made), “Result / How it helps” and short 15–30s demo clip. Keep language framed as product-case (not client).  
   - Metrics placeholders: “Saved ~X dev hours” etc.

5) DEMO ("/demo") — Systems Playground (important)  
   - Prominent link to a hosted Roblox experience (if available) and embedded short gameplay demo. If Roblox can't embed, link must be prominent with instructions: “Open in Roblox →” and a one-line description.  
   - Also include interactive web demos for Godot/GameMaker systems where feasible (e.g., simple JS-based mockups for UI interaction) — optional, but add a clear label “Interactive preview (demo-only)” and do not include full source.  
   - Clear label: “This demo is a simplified public preview — for bespoke, polished integrations, hire me.”

6) ABOUT ("/about")  
   - Short first-person bio: “Hi, I’m Emmet — systems developer for Roblox, Godot, GameMaker. I build modular backbones so teams can ship faster.” Keep it short and confident. Include experience line: “Roblox scripting since YYYY, Godot since v3.x” (use placeholder years).  
   - Values: Simplicity, modularity, clarity.  
   - Photo or avatar placeholder and contact CTA.

7) CONTACT ("/contact")  
   - Short form: Name, Email, Engine (dropdown), Project type (Pre-made / Custom), Budget (dropdown), Message (textarea), Upload (optional).  
   - After submit, show a confirmation page with next steps + expected response time message. (Make the response time text non-committal such as “You’ll hear back soon” — do not promise exact hours.)  
   - Also include social links: GitHub, Itch.io, Roblox profile, Twitter/X (or blank if not set).

8) REVIEWS / TESTIMONIALS ("/reviews") — simple gallery of fetched reviews (start with placeholders). Include CTA: “Leave a Review” with a lightweight form that appends to a reviews JSON file (for demo).

Site-wide UI & behavior (explicit):  
- Header: logo left, navigation (Home, Systems, Portfolio, Demo, About, Contact), small “Cart” icon (for future) and CTA button “Browse Systems” (primary). Sticky header on scroll.  
- Footer: Copyright, quick links, engines icons, small newsletter capture, legal links (TOS, Privacy — create placeholders).  
- Use modular card-based layout; spacing and grid consistent.  
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, alt tags, color contrast accessible, keyboard-navigable forms.  
- Performance: images compressed, thumbnails small, lazy-loading enabled for below-the-fold images.  
- SEO: meta title & meta description for each page (use descriptive templates). Add structured data (LD+JSON) for product pages (basic fields: name, description, price, currency USD).  
- Analytics: embed an analytics stub (owner can replace with GA or Plausible ID later). Provide instruction comment in code where to paste analytics ID.

Integrations & embeds (must be implemented as configurable placeholders):  
- Payments/downloads: Gumroad / Itch.io button placeholders. Implement one working example that links to a sandbox Gumroad product URL (owner will replace). Provide clear config file (site/config.json) with product metadata and external URLs.  
- Email capture: provide a basic working email capture that stores submissions to a simple JSON file (serverless Replit endpoint) and also a commented example for ConvertKit/Mailchimp embed code.  
- Demo/game embeds: allow an external Roblox link and an iframe/video preview. If Roblox embed is unavailable, place a large screenshot + “Open in Roblox” link.  
- Contact form: implement backend route (on Replit) to receive form POSTs, store them locally in a safe format, and email-forwarding instructions (owner must supply SMTP or connect a service later). For now, store submissions and show confirmation on the portal.

Developer & operational requirements (deliverables):  
1. Full static site deployed to Replit with a public URL. If Replit provides a subdomain like `emmet-builds.repl.co`, push that; also include exact instructions in README for pointing a custom domain (DNS records and Replit steps).  
2. Git repo in the Replit workspace with clear commit history.  
3. `site/config.json` file where the owner can edit: brand colors, engine icons URLs, products metadata, and external links (Gumroad, Itch, Roblox). All content text references must be driven by config where possible.  
4. `README.md` with: how to run locally, how to edit content, how to deploy, how to connect domain (step-by-step), how to replace placeholder embed keys (Gumroad, ConvertKit), how to export site.  
5. A minimal admin script/page (protected by a simple password in config) to view contact submissions and testimonials (no user accounts required). This is optional but preferred.  
6. Unit manual acceptance test steps in README for owner to confirm features work.

Copy & microcopy guidance (exact voice examples to use where text is needed):  
- Hero subheadline: “Modular systems for Roblox, Godot & GameMaker — plug-in code so you can finish your game.”  
- CTA primary: “Browse Systems” (secondary: “See Demo”)  
- Demo page note: “This is a public preview. I build production-ready, customizable integrations for hire.”  
- Contact success: “Thanks — I’ve received your message. I’ll review it and get back to you.”  
- Pricing CTA: “Prices start from $40 — get a quote.” (Use this exact phrasing where a short price line is required.)

Design assets & icons:  
- Use simple vector engine icons for Roblox, Godot, GameMaker (use free SVGs). Include a folder `assets/icons/`.  
- Placeholder screenshots and demo GIFs stored under `assets/demos/`. Use tiny compressed GIFs for the grid; full MP4 for product pages.

Security & legal:  
- Include a placeholder privacy policy page and terms with short one-paragraph templates (owner will customize).  
- Sanitize and validate all form inputs, and do not log passwords in plaintext.

Testing & acceptance criteria (must pass all):  
A. Visual: Site matches the structure above, responsive at 320px/768px/1200px, header and footer present site-wide.  
B. Systems Marketplace: Filter by engine works, product pages render with demo video and code-snippet preview, Buy button links to configured external product URL.  
C. Demo page: Roblox demo link is prominent and labeled correctly.  
D. Contact form: Submissions are stored and a confirmation UI appears.  
E. Email capture: Stores to local JSON and shows success message. (Optional: posts to ConvertKit if keys added).  
F. README: Contains exact domain-connection instructions and how to change product/config entries.  
G. Code quality: Clean, modular folder structure; comments on where to change colors/text/assets; no console errors in modern browsers.  
H. Accessibility: images have alt text, basic keyboard navigation works.

Deliverables (final):  
- Live URL (Replit) with site.  
- Git repo link or Replit workspace link.  
- `memory_dump.md` summary file included in repo (use the user-provided memory dump).  
- README plus short “what I changed” commit summary.  
- ZIP export of the static site (for future migration).

Timeline & confirmation:  
- No timelines in the prompt itself (the Replit agent should run immediately), but it must confirm completion by listing fulfilled acceptance criteria and providing the live URL + repo link.

Developer notes (do not deviate):  
- This site is a *developer portfolio + marketplace*. Keep interface professional and avoid flashy unrelated design patterns. Prioritize clarity & speed.  
- Protect source-code for paid assets: the demo shows behavior but does not expose full working scripts. Provide small snippet samples only.  
- All configuration strings (product prices, links, emails) must be editable in `site/config.json` — do not hardcode addresses in many files.

Quality check (final): run through acceptance criteria A–H, then publish an index page screenshot and a short changelog (3–5 bullets) in the repo root.

If anything below is ambiguous to you, implement the **closest specified behavior** above and add a clear comment in the README that explains the choice so the owner can change it.
